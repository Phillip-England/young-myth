DEV NOTES:

Sendgrid API Key Issues - sendgrid was causing me issues in sending emails. I was getting an SSL certificate error. Well, I ran the following command on macOS to get things working.

Here is the command. Keep in mind the 3.11 is pointing to your current version of python. If you have a newer version, you'll need to install for that specific version.

sudo /Applications/Python\ 3.11/Install\ Certificates.command
